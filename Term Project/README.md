# Blind Prediction of Critical Load Applied to a Cracked Beam

### OBJECTIVES:
* To get familiar with the commercial FEM software Abaqus;
* Study the performance of finite elements available in Abaqus;
* Get introduced to the application of the FEM to fracture problems:
* Determine the critical load of a simply supported beam with a crack at mid span.
